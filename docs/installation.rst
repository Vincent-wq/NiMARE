You'll need to set up a working development environment to use ``nimare``.
To set up a local environment, you will need Python >=3.6 and the following
packages will need to be installed:

- nibabel
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- statsmodels
- nipype
- scikit-learn

You can then install ``nimare`` with:
